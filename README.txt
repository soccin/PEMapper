# Version using old picard.local

Uses:
```
/opt/common/CentOS_6/picard/picard-tools-1.129/picard.jar
/opt/common/CentOS_6/java/jdk1.7.0_75/bin/java
```

Some of the picard functions no longer seem to work. Switch MASTER branch to
`picardV2` version:
```
JAVA=/opt/common/CentOS_6/java/jdk1.8.0_31/bin/java
PICARDJAR=/home/socci/Code/Picard/jar/picard.jar
```

But move the JAR into the repo
